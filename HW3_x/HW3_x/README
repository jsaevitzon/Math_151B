README:

All files are seperated into  a cpp file and header file. The files are:

Actual.cpp/h : contains the exact solution for y

euler.cpp/h  : contains the implementation and definition of euler method

rk4.cpp/h    : contains	the implementation and definition of Rung-Kutta  method

amb4.cpp/h   : contains the implementation and definition of adams predictor  method

ms.cpp/h     :contains	the implementation and definition of milne simpson method

function.cpp/h : contains   the implementation of the differential equation function  method

main.cpp  : contains the way to implement all methods

Makefile  : contains the way to build and run all functions

Adam_PC.png : graph for adams method
Euler.png   : graph for Euler method
mil_simp.png: graph for mil_simp method
Rung.png    : graph for rung-kutta method

graphs.gp : gnuplot directions to build the graphs.


How to build:
 Use makefile. Args are:
     make : builds all files to a target main. Can run main by ./main
     
         ./main takes args:
     	    ./main "euler": to run euler method
	    ./main "rk4"  : to run rung kutta
	    ./main "amb4" : to run adams method
	    ./main "ms"   : to run milne simp method
	    ./main "solution" : to run the actual solution

     rk4: builds and runs rk4. Outputs to rk4.csv
     euler: builds and runs euller, outputs to euler.csv
     amb4:  builds and runs adams, outputs to amb4.csv
     ms  :  builds and runs milne simp, outputs to ms.csv
     actual: builds and runs solution, outputs to sol.csv
     all: builds and runs all of the above
     
     graphs: builds all of the above and outputs the graphs (.png listed above)

     dist: does all of the above. Builds a zipe file of every file listed.
      

      

Questions:
	Eulers method is unstable for h=.125, .2. Converges for others.
	Adams converges for all but h=.2
	mil_simp is incredibly unstable. Does not converge at all.
	Rung kutta converges for all but h=.2. Clearly stable for h <= .125.
