As the step size decreases, the approximation becomes incredibly close to the actual result. This can be seen in the max differences. The max difference when the step size is 10 (415) is about 14x larger than when the step size is 1 (29.9) which is about 10x larger than when the step size is .1 (2.88). Thus when the step size is very small, the guess becomes very good, and as h->0, the difference goes to 0 as well.
